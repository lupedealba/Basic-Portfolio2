            <p>For a long time, I've introduced myself as a banjo player from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I'm a hiker and an 
    environmentalist. I'm an optimist. I'm loud. I'm still all those things, but I went quiet for a few years. 
    I cut my long hair short. I got a cat named Cat Stevens. I fell in love. I moved to New York, to France, and back. 
    Inevitably, I found my space in the place between knowing who I was and finding out who I am.

    <p id="second-paragraph"> I'm a songwriter, producer, and performer from Brooklyn. I'm an optimist. I'm a feminist. I'm loud when I laugh. 
    I'm freckled. I love my old jeans. I love pink eye shadow. I cry when I dance sometimes. I feel a lot, maybe too much, 
    but in a song, it always seems to be just enough.
